# Access Control
Access Control is based on main two aspects **Discretonary (DAC)**  and **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**. 

**Discretonary (DAC)** isÂ an *identity-based access control model that gives users some control over their data*.
- Each object has an owner. 
- Owner can grant access to that object

**Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**
Privileges -> Roles -> Users
